Process links in an HTML **string**. This can run as "server side rendering", i.e.,
on the client or server.  It's very fast and lightweight.  It can't install
a click handler (since it's just manipulating html), so it can't do things
like open a link to a project from within cocalc internally without opening
another page.  This is, of course, meant to be used in contexts like the
share server.

TODO: this is NOT used anywhere yet.
