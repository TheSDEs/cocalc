            share any URL in your project and when somebody visits that URL they
            will automatically be added as a collaborator to your project. All
            collaborators who are not the owner will be removed if they are not
            active for about 10 minutes. Any trial, member hosting, and network
            banners are also not visible.

            content of this project, and have no concern about potential cross
            site scripting attacks, e.g., you are running cocalc on a private
            network, or only share this URL with trusted people.
