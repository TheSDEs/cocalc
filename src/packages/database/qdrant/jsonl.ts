/*
Save and restore the *data* in a collection to/from a jsonl  file.
That's json-lines, i.e., https://jsonlines.org/

I wrote this because it's faster and "easier to trust" than Qdrant's built in
snapshot functionality for my use case.  It actually seems like this is 10x faster,
probably because it discards all the indexing and other internal metadata.
That's OK for our longterm backups though.

Use json lines directly is also nice since we can make incremental deduped backups
using bup, and also just visibly inspect the data to see it is there.
It's also useful for dumping a collection, changing params, and reading the collection
back in.
