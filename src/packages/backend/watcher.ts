/*
Watch one SINGLE FILE for changes.   Use ./path-watcher.ts for a directory.

Watch for changes to the given file, which means the mtime changes or the
mode changes (e.g., readonly versus readwrite).  Returns obj, which
is an event emitter with events:

   - 'change', ctime, stats - when file changes or is created
   - 'delete' - when file is deleted

and a method .close().

Only fires after the file definitely has not had its
ctime changed for at least debounce ms.  Does NOT
fire when the file first has ctime changed.

NOTE: for directories we use chokidar in path-watcher.  However,
for a single file using polling, chokidar is horribly buggy and
lacking in functionality (e.g., https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/issues/1132),
and declared all bugs fixed, so we steer clear.  It had a lot of issues
with just noticing actual file changes.

We *always* use polling to fully support networked filesystems.
