## Install CoCalc on your server or computer

You can obtain a packaged version of CoCalc for your own on-premises infrastructure: [**CoCalc Cloud**](https://doc-cloud.cocalc.com/).
It runs on Kubernetes and inherits the security and scalability of the SaaS platform.

## History

_CoCalc_ was formerly called _SageMathCloud_.
It started to offer way more than just SageMath and hence outgrew itself.
The name was coined in fall 2016 and changed around spring 2017.
